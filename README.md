**Vacuum Cleaner Simulation**

This project is a fun and interactive vacuum cleaner simulation, developed in Java using the java.awt package for the graphical interface. A dynamic red triangle (our virtual vacuum cleaner) chases after black dots that appear on the gray canvas when you click. Each dot represents a speck of "dust," and the vacuum relentlessly hunts them down!

**Key Features**

**Interactive GUI**: Click on the gray surface to add black dots, and watch the red triangle automatically chase them.

**Smooth Animations**: The triangle moves smoothly across the canvas, demonstrating efficient pathfinding.

**Multithreading**: Powered by Java threads, ensuring seamless performance as the simulation updates in real-time.

**Control via Keyboard**: Press the space bar to stop and resume the vacuum's movement, giving you control over the simulation.

**How it Works**

This simulation leverages Java's threading capabilities to run smoothly. The triangle (vacuum cleaner) constantly recalculates its path to the nearest dot while multiple threads handle the animation and user interaction concurrently
